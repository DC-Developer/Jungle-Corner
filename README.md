# Jungle-Corner
                                                      Overview: 
  This site is based off of League of Legends, the world's most popular online multiplayer moba game. Jungle-Corner takes in ranked-game information and statistics of the opposing team that you're matched with. It uses Riot's api to get this data. The purpose of Jungle-Corner is to help a specific role, "Jungle", quickly determine the most optimal lane/person to focus on. It does this by strategically honing in on certain ranked-statistics of each enemy player, so the person playing the jungle role is able to quickly form a strong strategy.
